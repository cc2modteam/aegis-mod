Support module for the Aegis Radar Application.

The Aegis system is two parts, this mod, and a windows app that acts
as a launcher for CC2. When in use, the Aegis desktop app renders an extra
window showing the location of visible units on the map (the same units you
 can see from a control screen or the Holomap).

It renders in the same kind of style as an air-traffic control screen and also
records the movement of units over time to a file on disk that can be played
back later.
